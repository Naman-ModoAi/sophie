Built for

🎯 Sales reps & founders running deals

💼 Consultants & partners leading client conversations

⚖️ Advisors, lawyers & recruiters in high-stakes meetings

*If your work depends on conversations, SophiHQ is for you.*

The problem

## **Right before an important call, you're probably:**

Googling the company last minute

Skimming LinkedIn while joining Zoom

Trying to remember who's who and why this meeting exists

That's not preparation.

**That's winging it.**  
And clients notice.

## 

Your calendar tells you ***when*** the meeting is.

It doesn't help you understand what actually matters for the conversation.

Who you're meeting

What they care about

What to focus on in this conversation  
*SophiHQ fills that gap — automatically.*

How it works

## **Simple. Automatic. Ready.**

### **Connect your calendar**

2

### **SophiHQ does the homework**

We pull together context on the company, attendees, and situation around each meeting.

3

### **You show up ready**

A short, skimmable brief — before every call.  
*No prep. No tabs. No scrambling.*

What you get

## **Every meeting gets a clear prep brief.**

### 

Know the company

* What they do  
* What's happening now  
* Why this meeting matters

### 

Know the people
